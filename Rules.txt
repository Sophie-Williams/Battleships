   arena.    This is done by the player entering the 
   alignment (V or H) followed by the coordinates entered
   in the format
           say K N to select the coordinate (K,N).            //P.T.O.//

2. The computer then deploys its own set of 6 ships in a 
   different arena.
   

   THE ACTION STARTS HERE!!

   in Player's arena where Player's ships have been deployed.
